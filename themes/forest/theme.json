  "aiRules": [
    "CAVE: Every group of 'cave' floor tiles MUST have at least one 'cave-entry' floor tile directly adjacent (up/down/left/right). cave-entry is the only way in or out of cave tiles. Place cave-entry between ground and cave tiles as a doorway. Without cave-entry the cave is completely inaccessible. Caves are DARK — the player cannot see or interact with anything inside without a torch. To get a torch: either place 'item-torch' directly, OR place 'thorny-bush' + 'item-machete' (cutting the bush gives a stick) + a 'fire' tile nearby (the player lights the stick at the fire to make a torch). Always ensure the player can obtain a torch BEFORE entering the cave.",
    "WATER: If the player needs to cross water, place an 'item-raft' somewhere reachable on ground. The player can only cross 1 water tile at a time with the raft, so for wider crossings place stepping-stone ground tiles so each water gap is only 1 tile wide.",
    "SNOW: The player cannot walk on snow without a sweater. If using snow tiles, place an 'item-sweater' on reachable ground.",
    "DOORS: Every 'door-key' or 'door-card' must have a matching 'item-key' or 'item-card' with the same lockColor config. Place walkable tiles on both sides of a door.",
    "FIRE: If fire blocks a required path, place an 'item-bucket' nearby. The player fills it at water, then uses it to extinguish fire.",
    "BEAR: If a bear blocks a required path, place an 'item-knife' somewhere reachable. The player uses the knife to defeat the bear.",
    "TREES: If a tree blocks a required path, place an 'item-axe' somewhere reachable. Cutting a tree gives wood.",
    "BOULDERS: If a boulder blocks a required path, place an 'item-pickaxe' somewhere reachable.",
    "THORNY BUSHES: If a thorny bush blocks a required path, place an 'item-machete' somewhere reachable. Cutting a bush gives a stick.",
    "BURIED ITEMS: Ground and snow tiles can hide items underground. To bury an item, add floorConfig: { hiddenObject: { type: 'item-knife', config: {} } }. Always pair buried items with an 'item-shovel' on the map so the player can dig."
